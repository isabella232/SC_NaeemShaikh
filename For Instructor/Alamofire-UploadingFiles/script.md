## Introduction

"Hey what's up everybody, this is Naeem. In today's screencast, I'm going to introduce you to a really popular networking library called Alamofire."

Alamofire provides an elegant interface on top of Apple’s Foundation networking stack that simplifies a number of common networking tasks.

Alamofire’s elegance comes from the fact it was written from the ground up in Swift and does not inherit anything from its Objective-C counterpart, AFNetworking.

Before we get started, I want to give a big shout out to Aaron Douglas. Aaron wrote a tutorial on Alamofire which is the basis of this screencast. Thanks Aaron.

Adding Alamofire to your app is super easy, so let's dive in.
