## Introduction

"Hey what's up everybody, this is Naeem. In today's screencast, I'm going to show you how to refactor code duplication and provide centralized configuration for Alamofire network calls."

You probably have some repeated code in your Alamofire network calls, like authentication token, API version etc.
Alamofire provides a simple method to eliminate this code duplication and provide centralized configuration. The technique involves creating a struct conforming to the `URLRequestConvertible` protocol and updating your networking calls.

Before we get started, I want to give a big shout out to Aaron Douglas. Aaron wrote a tutorial on Alamofire which is the basis of this screencast. Thanks Aaron.

Refactoring repeated code in Alamofire is super easy, so let's dive in.
